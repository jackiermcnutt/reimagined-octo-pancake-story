There once was a girl who was lost in a dark and dreary woods. She walked for 10 hours but still cannot find a way out.
She ran into a witch, who offered to help her find a way out.  
The witch turned out to be evil.

She cursed the girl and the girl blacked out. When the girl came to, she has this strange feeling that she needed to find a person of great power. A power that was unknown to man. She closed her eyes and imaged the following. A dark castle,the sky black above it. It had four points of towers. The girl, Lila, furrowed hher brows as her brown eyes opened. What was that all about? Lila had never been to a castle like this one before. She was a farm girl who milked cows for her family. A servent girl, who was now cursed to finish a quest she didn't know how to begin.
